If you have other questions about the framework or would like further information about a question, just let me know by leaving a message on the FAQ discusion in the Mvp4g Google group (http://groups.google.com/group/mvp4g/browse_thread/thread/d8ee207598bf02fa).

## What's the class diagram of the framework? ##
![http://mvp4g.googlecode.com/svn/tags/mvp4g-1.2.0/documentation/uml/mvp4g_class_diagram_overview.png](http://mvp4g.googlecode.com/svn/tags/mvp4g-1.2.0/documentation/uml/mvp4g_class_diagram_overview.png)

## What's a presenter? ##
In a MVP architecture, the presenter is in charge of the logic of the application. It acts upon the model and the view.<br />
In the Mvp4g framework, a presenter is also an object that implements the PresenterInterface.

## What's a view? ##
In the MVP architecture, a view is the object that displays the data and routes user commands to the presenter to act upon that data.<br />
In the Mvp4g framework, a view can be any type of object. The developer is free to use any widgets library he wants.

## What's a service? ##
In the Mvp4g framework, a service is build thanks to GWT deferred binding (ie thanks to GWT.create method). The goal of this type of elements is to communicate with the server.

## What's an event bus and how can it dispatch events? ##
The event bus is a Java object, generated by the Mvp4g library in charge of dispatching events between the presenters.<br />
It allows presenters to communicate between each other without a direct link between them (no spaghetti effect).

## When and how are presenters, views and services instantiated? When and how views and services injected into presenters? When is the event bus created and configured? ##
All these actions are done thanks to the following lines:
```
Mvp4gModule module = (Mvp4gModule)GWT.create( Mvp4gModule.class );
module.createAndStartModule();
RootLayoutPanel.get().add( (Widget)module.getStartView() );
```

The first line creates a Java class thanks to the configuration using GWT Deferred Binding feature.

The call to the createAndStartModule method will:
  * create the needed instance of views, services, presenters and history converters.
  * create the event bus.
  * injects views, services and event bus in the presenters.

Thanks to the third line, the start view of the module is added to the Root panel.

## Is Mvp4g compatible with all browsers? ##

Mvp4g is 100% Java so it is guaranted to be compatible with all the browsers thanks to the GWT compiler.

## How fast is Mvp4g compared to GWT Handler Manager? ##

You can look at this page [Mvp4g Performances](Mvp4gPerformances.md) that compares Mvp4g and GWT Handler Manager. As you can see with the result, Mvp4g event bus processes events faster than [GWT HandlerManager](http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/event/shared/HandlerManager.html). However time to process a few events is almost equal to 0 for both event bus and in most cases applications won't send more than 1 or 2 events at a time. To sum up, you can use Mvp4g without worrying to make your application slow.

## Can Mvp4g be used with gwt-dispath or restful services? ##

Yes, Mvp4g let you use anything you want for the back-end communication. You can look at
  * [this simple project](http://code.google.com/p/mvp4g/source/browse/#svn/tags/mvp4g-1.2.0/examples/Mvp4gWithEdgebox) to see a working of Mvp4g with restful services.
  * [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/mvp4g/browse_thread/thread/f68783da19b776f/dda6a4b432f6552a?lnk=gst&q=dispatch#dda6a4b432f6552a) to have feedbacks about integrating gwt-dispatch with mvp4g.

## Can I still use an xml file to configure my application? ##
Mvp4g 1.2.0 is the last version that supports XML configuration.

## Migrating from 1.3 to 1.4 ##
A few changes in your code is needed when moving from 1.3 to 1.4:
  * The 'startView' attribute of @Events has been replaced by 'startPresenter'. Instead of setting the start view, you should replace it by the start presenter.
  * The 'modulesToLoad' attribute of @Event has been renamed 'forwardToModules'.
  * If you have defined a custom place service, it shouldn't be abstract anymore.
